Rules to make changes as smooth as possible: 
1) Open GitHub Desktop and fetch origin from main branch to be up to date
2) Switch over to your branch so updates aren't in main branch (if this happens close unity and see if it'll let you switch changes over to your branch)
3) Work in Unity as normal (keep it at one person in Unity at a time to keep simple)
4) Once done with Unity, save project and CLOSE UNITY (uploading changes won't work with Unity open)
5) Push changes from your branch on GitHub Desktop (add summary of what you did)
6) Create Pull Request and fo over steps on GitHub website
7) Everything should be green when making merges from pull request
8) Once completed DELETE BRANCH you were working on
9) Check main branch to see if your changes are most recent update
10) Immediately make new branch that you'll work on next
11) Repeat steps 1-10
